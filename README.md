# Product Landing Page
FreeCodeCamp "Responsive Web Design" Project

### Project Constrains:

- **Plain HTML and CSS**
- Product landing page should have a **header** element with a corresponding `id="header"`
- There is an image within the **header** element with a corresponding `id="header-img"`. A company logo would make a good image here
- Within the `#header` element you can see a **nav** element with a corresponding `id="nav-bar"`
- You can see at least _three clickable elements_ inside the **nav** element, each with the class `nav-link`
- When you click a `.nav-link` **button** in the **nav** element, you are taken to the corresponding **section** of the landing page
- You can watch an embedded product **video** with `id="video"`
- Landing page has a **form** element with a corresponding `id="form"`
- Within the **form**, there is an **input** field with `id="email"` where you can enter an email address
- The `#email` **input** field should have _placeholder_ text to let the user know what the field is for
- The `#email` **input** field uses _HTML5 validation_ to confirm that the entered text is an email address
- Within the **form**, there is a _submit_ input with a corresponding `id="submit"`
- When you click the `#submit` element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit)
- The _navbar_ should always be at the _top_ of the viewport
- Product landing page should have at least one _media query_
- Product landing page should utilize _CSS flexbox_ at least once
